abstract = {Deep Blue is the chess machine that defeated then-reigning World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match in 1997. There were a number of factors that contributed to this success, including: •a single-chip chess search engine,•a massively parallel system with multiple levels of parallelism,•a strong emphasis on search extensions,•a complex evaluation function, and•effective use of a Grandmaster game database. This paper describes the Deep Blue system, and gives some of the rationale that went into the design decisions behind Deep Blue.}
